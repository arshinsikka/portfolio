Create a “Work Experience” section for my portfolio website using React and Tailwind CSS. This section should focus only on internships and professional work experience — student leadership roles will be added separately.

Use a vertical timeline or clean stacked card layout. Each item should include:
- Job Title
- Company Name and Location
- Dates
- 1–2 sentence description
- Tags displayed as pill-style badges

Here is the content to display:

Layout instructions:
- Use subtle shadows and spacing between items
- Make it responsive for mobile and desktop
- Use a section ID of “experience” so I can link to it later

Optional: If possible, make this a reusable `<ExperienceCard />` component for maintainability.
