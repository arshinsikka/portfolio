Create a "Projects" section for my portfolio website using React and Tailwind CSS.

The layout should be a responsive grid with stylish project cards that contain:
1. Project title
2. My role and dates
3. A short 1–2 sentence description
4. Tech tags as pill-style badges
5. Optional: placeholder for an image or logo I will upload later (e.g., lectureai.png, trackup.png)

Each card should have subtle hover effects, consistent spacing, and look good on both desktop and mobile.

Use the following content for each card:

Design Tips:
- Use `grid-cols-1` on small screens, and `grid-cols-2` or `grid-cols-3` on medium/large.
- Use Tailwind shadow and transition for clean hover animations.
- Make each project block a reusable React component if possible.

Wrap everything inside a `<section id="projects">` so I can link to it from the nav bar later.
