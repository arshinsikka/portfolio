Please implement the following 5 UI/UX improvements across my portfolio website using React and Tailwind CSS:

---

### 1. Sticky Navbar with Smooth Scroll (🔥 High Priority)

- Add a responsive, sticky top navbar with smooth scroll links to all major sections:
  - Home
  - About
  - Experience
  - Projects
  - Research
  - Leadership
  - Contact
- Highlight the currently active section as the user scrolls (e.g. underline or bold)
- On mobile, use a hamburger menu or responsive collapse behavior

---

### 2. “Visit Website” CTA on Lecture AI Project Card (🔥 High Priority)

- In the **Lecture AI** project card, add a clearly visible “Visit Website” button below the description
- Link it to: https://lectureai.vercel.app
- Use a button style consistent with the rest of the site (e.g., `bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded`)
- Optional: Add a subtle hover animation or icon (`↗`) to indicate it opens a new tab

---

### 3. Alternate Background Colors for Sections (✅ Medium Priority)

- Alternate section backgrounds to improve visual separation
  - Example:
    - About Me → White (`bg-white`)
    - Work Experience → `bg-gray-50`
    - Projects → `bg-white`
    - Research → `bg-gray-50`
    - Leadership → `bg-white`
    - Contact → `bg-gray-50`
- Keep contrast good and text readable throughout

---

### 4. Footer Social Icons with Tooltips (✅ Medium Priority)

- Add `title` attributes or hover tooltips to all social icons in the footer:
  - Instagram → “Follow on Instagram”
  - Telegram → “Message on Telegram”
  - LinkedIn → “Connect on LinkedIn”
  - WhatsApp → “Chat on WhatsApp”
  - GitHub → “View my GitHub”
- Ensure tooltips appear on hover (you can use Tailwind tooltip plugin or native browser titles)

---

### 5. Dark Mode Toggle (⭐ Bonus)

- Add a dark/light mode toggle button in the top right corner of the navbar
- Use Tailwind’s `dark:` classes and `darkMode: 'class'` in `tailwind.config.js`
- Toggle should persist user preference in `localStorage`
- Ensure all text, background, and tag colors adapt cleanly to dark mode
- Icons and buttons should remain visually accessible in both modes

---

Apply all changes consistently and make sure layout remains mobile-friendly.
